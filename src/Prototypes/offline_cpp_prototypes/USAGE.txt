Usage for Offline C++
The structure of the C++ prototype is very similar to the final implementation that gets loaded
onto the hardware. The main difference is this version uses a separate driver program to feed
in audio as opposed to a microphone. To use this prototype, just compile test.cpp along with
effect_pitch_shift.cpp and run the executable.

The input wav file, output wav file, algorithm choice starting period in samples, and target 
period in samples are all defined by the user at runtime. If TD-PSOLA is the algorithm selected,
it is best to test with a wav file that only has one pitch, as it relies on having an accurate
starting period. Phase-Vocoding only relies on the ratio between the starting period and the 
target period so this is not an issue.

compilation command:
g++ --std==c+11 -O3 test.cpp effect_shift_pitch.cpp -o [executable name]

Python prototype usage:
Each file is stand alone with corresponding imports of the modules below in the beginning of the
code. The code is commented to tell the user where they are able to modify lines in the program.
An example is the pitch in which the user can change the number. Each of these prototypes can
either take in a wav file or use a built in sine generator function. Outputs after shifting by
the amount specified in the .py file will be produced while running the code.

The program accepts either a .wav file as input or generates an ideal sin wave at a specific frequency 
to be used as input.  The pitch shift ratio (denoted by f_ratio), synthesis hop size and analysis hop size 
are all defined at the beginning of the process.  The program starts in the analysis stage by calling the stft() 
function in order to acquire RFFT data from the entire signal; a hanning window is applied to the input, and 
each RFFT is separated by the analysis hopsize.  

After the RFFTs have been taken, the function doit() is called and the synthesis stage begins.  This function 
computes the unwrapped-phase difference between respective frequencies bins in neighboring rows of the previously 
calculated STFT matrix.  The unwrapped-phase difference is then multiplied by the pitch shift ratio and added to 
the previous synthesized resultâ€™s phase to get the newly synthesized phase for the current iteration.  This newly 
synthesized phase, along with the magnitude data from the current analysis window, is used to compute the newly 
synthesized RFFT result.  These synthesized RFFT results get stored within the 2-dimensional synth[] array. 

When the synth[] array has been completely filled, the script then calls the istft() function in order to get the 
synthesized result into the time domain.  The istft() function takes the inverse RFFT on each row of the 2-dimensional 
synth[] array and stores them in a  1-dimensional array to be outputted.  Consecutive inverse RFFT results get 
overlapped and added by the synthesis hopsize amount.  The resulting output is the time stretched version of the input. 

The final step is to resample the time stretched output in order to perform the desired pitch shift.  This is performed 
with the sf.write() function.  The filename is the first argument, the time stretched output is the second argument, 
and sampling frequency of the output is the third argument.  The sampling frequency must be the initial sampling frequency 
of the input multiplied by the pitch shift ratio in order for the output signal to be the correct duration and pitch.

A line level monophonic input should be sent into the line_in pins on the Teensy audio shield.
The hardware we designed converts an xlr mic output to this line level signal, but an 1/8"
audio source running directly into the audio shield will also work. The output will be sent
out of the audio shield and can be connected to headphones, speakers or a recording device. 

A USB MIDI controller can be directly plugged into the usb port that is connected to the header
pins on the teensy. MIDI control can also come from a separate USB host by plugging the Teensy
into the host with a micro-USB to USB-A cable. The Teensy should detect which type of connection
it is using should automatically be selectable as a MIDI output device on the host side. 

Once everything is connected, the user need only sing or play an instrument into the input while
using the MIDI control and the Harmonizer will output the pitch shifted harmonies.
